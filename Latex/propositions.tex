  % \item Process-based modeling of aeolian sediment transport, once
  %   sediment availability is given, is well understood. Process-based
  %   modeling of sediment availability, on the other hand, is still a
  %   challenge that can only be solved multidisciplinary.

  \item Coastal dune growth is governed by hydrodynamic rather than
    aeolian processes.
    % narrow beach -> erosion
    % wide beach -> armoring
    % wide fine beach -> not narrow

  \item The shear velocity threshold is the best available concept to
    account for limitations in aeolian sediment availability.

  \item Process-based modeling of sediment availability can best be
    continued by online coupling rather than expansion of existing
    models.

  \item Construction height is a better indicator for aeolian sediment
    supply from mega nourishments than surface area or volume.

  \item All scientific publications, data, software and even
    correspondence must be real-time accessible to anyone.
    % contributions should be logged a la wikipedia to keep track of
    % ownership

  \item Engineering science is more about experience and common sense
    than statistical confidence.
    % From Oxford website: Engineering Science encompasses a vast range
    % of subjects, from micro-electronics to offshore oil platforms, and
    % involves the application of creative reasoning, science,
    % mathematics (and of course experience and common sense) to real
    % problems.

  \item The absence of common cause is a better explanation to the
    observed rise of populism in the Western world than a silent
    majority, globalization or traditional divisions in society
    (e.g. prosperity, education, ethnicity).
    % not more people vote
    % no more foreign people are leftwing
    % not (only) the uneducated voted for Trump/Wilders
    
%  \item Restrictions on our national funding of personal education
%    will reduce the number of students, but increase the quality of
%    education.

%  \item The smart phone brought us freedom of communication,
%    information and observation.
%    % by cheap electronic sensors

  \item Keeping focus is an underrated skill.
    % geen vacatures met focus als eis
    % \item Experts are overrated.

  \item The time efficiency of raising twins is larger than any other
    parallel process as the overhead is negative.

  \item ``Never send a human to do a machine's job'' (Agent Smith in
    The Matrix, 1999).

%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item Aeolian sediment availability influences aeolian sediment
%  transport. Vice versa, aeolian sediment transport influences the
%  sediment availability. Therefore, no isolated approach to
%  schematization or parameterization of sediment availability will
%  suffice.
%
%\item Small scale and short-term spatiotemporal variations in aeolian
%  sediment availability are not important to large scale and long-term
%  aeolian sediment transport.
%  % but can be parameterized
%
%\item Capitalism will evolve naturally to a shared society, which is
%  close to idealized communism.
%
%\item The increase of scientific degrees in our society does not
%  reflect an increased accessibility to these degrees, but a
%  devaluation of these degrees.
%  % negative connotation
%
%\item A modeller without experience in the field is like a politician:
%  they overestimate the effectiveness of their work and the importance
%  of details.
%
%\item Publishing a peer-reviewed paper is a time-consuming
%  process. Therefore, reviews should be more critical.
%  % and so is reading one
%  % or: we should publish less mediocre articles
%
%\item A project team that consists in majority of PhD candidates is
%  not a project team.
%  % there is no sense of group effort
%
%\item Temporal deposits of aeolian sediment restricts aeolian sediment
%  transport similar to soil moisture and should therefore be treated
%  as a supply-limiter (this thesis).
%
%\item Coastal aeolian transport is governed by Poseidon rather than
%  Aeolus. Only temporal variations in transport are governed by wind,
%  but initation and the spatial variation of transport are governed by
%  moist.
%
%\item The duality or trinity of aeolian sediment availability
%  schematization is based on a paradox.
%
%\item Being able to share is key to creativity, progress and
%  ultimately success. The holds for data, software as well as for
%  coastal flood protection. (building with nature)
%
%\item Nike is right: just do it.
%
%\item The NYPD is right: first shoot than ask questions.
