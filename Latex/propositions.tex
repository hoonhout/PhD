  \item Coastal dune growth is dominated by subaqueous and not by
    subaerial processes.

  \item The construction height of a mega nourishment is a critical
    design parameter for aeolian sediment supply and dune growth.

  \item Aeolian sediment availability relates to the fluid shear
    velocity threshold, whereas aeolian sediment supply also relates
    to the impact shear velocity threshold.

  \item Coupled models can help crossing model limits, while model
    crossings are likely to limit modeled physics.

  \item All scientific publications, data, software and even
    correspondence must be real-time accessible to anyone.

  \item Confident engineers are not confined to statistical
    confidence.

  \item A shared interest simplifies societal issues. In absence of a
    shared interest societal issues are made simplistic.
     
  \item Keeping focus is an underrated skill.

  \item The parallel efficiency of raising twins is super-linear.

    \item De groei van kustduinen wordt gedomineerd door processen
      onder zeeniveau en niet door processen boven zeeniveau.
      
    \item De constructiehoogte van een megasuppletie is een kritische
      ontwerpparameter voor de aanvoer van eolisch sediment en
      duingroei.
      
    \item De beschikbaarheid van eolisch sediment is gerelateerd aan
      de drempelwaarde van de schuifspanningssnelheid bij initiatie
      van korrelbeweging, terwijl de aanvoer van eolisch sediment ook
      is gerelateerd aan de drempelwaarde van de

      statistische betrouwbaarheid.

%    Motivation: & Moved away from the aeolian/hydrodynamic discussion. \\
%  \end{tabular}
%
%\item Construction height of a mega nourishment is a critical design
%  parameter for aeolian sediment supply and dune growth.
%
%  \begin{tabular}{l p{8cm}}
%    Form:       & Factual \\
%    Was:        & Construction height is a better indicator for aeolian
%                  sediment supply from mega nourishments than surface area or
%                  volume. \\
%    Motivation: & Moved from 4 to 2. Changed the form, not the message. \\
%  \end{tabular}
%
%\item The fluid shear velocity threshold relates to aeolian sediment
%  availability, whereas the impact shear velocity threshold relates
%  to aeolian sediment supply.
%
%  \begin{tabular}{l p{8cm}}

%    Was:        & The shear velocity threshold is the best available
%                  concept to account for limitations in aeolian sediment
%                  availability and supply. \\
%    Motivation: & Moved from 2 to 3. I did not succeed in getting the shear velocity
%                  threshold, critical fetch and sediment supply in a single
%                  proposition without getting it way too long. Therefore I now only
%                  discuss the definition of the shear velocity threshold. In aeolian
%                  research sediment supply and availability are mixed up all the
%                  time. However, they are different if sediment availability/supply
%                  varies spatially, which is almost always the case in coastal
%                  environments. To distinguish between the two we need a more
%                  accurate description of aeolian sediment availability and supply,

%    Motivation: &  Moved from 3 to 4. Moved away from ``process-based'' modeling,
%                  ``online'' coupling, and the comparison form. Also changed the
%                  form into a word play that is supposed to be entertaining for

%    Was:        & Engineering science is more about experience and common

%    Motivation: & The message should be that statistical confidence is not

%    Motivation: & From computer science terminology: the time efficiency of a
%                  parallel process is called the parallel efficiency (speedup /
%                  number of processes), a parallel processes with an efficiency larger than unity
%                  is called super-linear. I played around with adding (mathematical)

%  \item Coastal dune growth is governed by hydrodynamic rather than
%    aeolian processes.
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Along narrow beaches dunes grow when hydrodynamic
%      erosion is absent, aeolian sediment transport is of secondary
%      importance.
%    \item Along wide beaches dunes grow if the beach is unarmored,
%      hence if the beach is periodically flooded, aeolian sediment
%      transport is of secondary importance.
%    \item Along wide beaches with fine sand only, hence armoring
%      cannot occur, the beach is destined to become narrow unless a
%      consistent supply of sediment is present... from marine sources.
%    \end{itemize}
%
%  \item The shear velocity threshold is the best available concept to
%    account for limitations in aeolian sediment availability and
%    supply.
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Critical fetch and supply are intangible.
%    \item Both are conceptual by nature and cannot be measured easily
%      in the field.
%    \item Both are highly variable and depend on many environmental
%      aspects.
%    \item Both do not allow for a feedback between sediment
%      availability and transport.
%    \item Both lack data for proper quantification.
%    \end{itemize}
%
%  \item Process-based modeling of sediment availability can best be
%    continued by online coupling rather than expansion of existing
%    models.
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Sediment availability is a truly multidisciplinary aspect of
%      aeolian sediment transport.
%    \item Relations with other disciplines, like hydrodynamics,
%      morphodynamics, hydrology, ecology and meteorology are not
%      peripheral, but touch the essence of aeolian sediment
%      availability.
%    \end{itemize}
%
%  \item Construction height is a better indicator for aeolian sediment
%    supply from mega nourishments than surface area or volume.

%      scientific discussions can be logged like Wikipedia to keep
%      track of ownership.
%    \item It is good, if science is a collaborative effort to
%      understand the world around us. It maximizes quality and the use
%      of brain power, creativity, enthusiasm, and time. It minimizes
%      prejudice, fraud and honest mistakes.

%
%  \item Engineering science is more about experience and common sense
%    than statistical confidence.
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item On engineering time and spatial scales, the lack of data
%      leads to unusable confidence intervals. Yet we tend to do a
%      pretty good job, because there is common sense.

%    \item Not significantly more latino/afro-american people vote for Clinton.
%    \item Only significant difference in urban/country people.
%    \item Brexit also a significant difference between young/old

%    \item First response: ignore, repeat or something in the middle.
%    \item This is history in the making. Is it just time for change?
%      Like WWI?
%    \end{itemize}
%    
%  \item Keeping focus is an underrated skill.
%
