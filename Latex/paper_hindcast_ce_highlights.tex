\item 4-year hindcast of supratidal morphological development of the
  Sand Motor mega nourishment using the \textsc{AeoLiS} model for
  aeolian sediment availability and transport.
\item \textsc{AeoLiS} captures the supratidal morphodynamic behaviour
  at the Sand Motor, which is characterized by the significant
  compartmentalization, modest aeolian sediment transport rates and
  relatively low dune growth rates.
\item The \textsc{AeoLiS} model is able to reproduce multi-annual
  aeolian sediment transport rates in the Sand Motor domain in the
  four years after its construction with a RMSE of $3 \cdot 10^4 ~
  \mathrm{m^3}$ (7\% of the total sediment accumulation of $40 \cdot
  10^4 ~ \mathrm{m^3}$) and $\mathrm{R^2}$ of 0.93 when time series of
  measured and modeled total aeolian sediment transport volumes are
  compared.
